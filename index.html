                <p>
                    Pressing the button will send XMLHTTPRequest with a custom header "Test-Header" set to the value
                    from the input. This value will then be used to spawn a simple worker thread which searches for all
                    prime numbers up to the given limit. A network reply is then created which contains JSON array of the
                    results as well as the "Test-Header" with used value (except it doesn't).
